## 1. Data Cleaning

### Definition:
Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting (or removing) errors and inconsistencies in data to improve its quality. This step is crucial because the quality of your data directly impacts the performance of your machine learning models.

### Key Tasks:
- **Handling Missing Data:** 
  - Methods include removing rows/columns with missing values, imputing missing values using the mean, median, or mode, or using more advanced techniques like K-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation.
  - Example: If a dataset has missing entries in the "Age" column, you can replace them with the mean age of the dataset.
- **Outlier Detection and Removal:**
  - Outliers can be detected using statistical methods like the Z-score or IQR method and can be removed or corrected if they are erroneous.
  - Example: In a dataset of house prices, an outlier might be a house listed at a price significantly higher or lower than the rest, which could skew model predictions.
- **Data Consistency:**
  - Ensuring consistency in data format, units of measurement, and naming conventions.
  - Example: Converting all date formats to a standard format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).

## 2. Feature Selection

### Definition:
Feature selection involves identifying and selecting the most relevant features from your dataset that contribute the most to the predictive power of the model. This step reduces the dimensionality of the data and helps in building simpler, faster, and more interpretable models.

### Techniques:
- **Filter Methods:**
  - Select features based on their statistical properties, such as correlation with the target variable.
  - Example: Pearson correlation coefficient can be used to select features that have a high correlation with the output variable.
- **Wrapper Methods:**
  - Use a subset of features and train a model to evaluate their effectiveness. Techniques include forward selection, backward elimination, and recursive feature elimination (RFE).
  - Example: RFE iteratively removes the least important features based on model performance until the optimal set is found.
- **Embedded Methods:**
  - Feature selection is performed as part of the model training process. Techniques like Lasso (L1 regularization) shrink less important feature coefficients to zero, effectively selecting a subset of features.
  - Example: Lasso regression can be used to automatically select features by penalizing large coefficients.

## 3. Feature Extraction

### Definition:
Feature extraction is the process of transforming raw data into a set of features that can be used as inputs to a machine learning model. This process is particularly useful when the original data is too large or complex to be used directly.

### Techniques:
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
  - PCA reduces the dimensionality of the data by transforming the original features into a new set of uncorrelated features (principal components) that capture the most variance in the data.
  - Mathematical Formulation:
    - $$ Z = XW $$
    - Where $Z$ is the matrix of principal components, $X$ is the original data matrix, and $W$ is the matrix of eigenvectors.
  - Example: Reducing the dimensionality of a dataset with hundreds of features to a smaller set of principal components while retaining most of the variance.
- **Text Feature Extraction (TF-IDF, Word Embeddings):**
  - Techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings convert text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning models.
  - Example: Converting a corpus of text into TF-IDF vectors to use in text classification tasks.

## 4. Normalization

### Definition:
Normalization is the process of adjusting the values of features to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values. This is particularly important for algorithms that compute distances between data points, such as KNN or SVM.

### Techniques:
- **Min-Max Scaling:**
  - Rescales the feature values to a fixed range, typically [0, 1].
  - Mathematical Formulation:
    - $$ x' = \frac{x - x_{\text{min}}}{x_{\text{max}} - x_{\text{min}}} $$
    - Where $x$ is the original value, $x_{\text{min}}$ and $x_{\text{max}}$ are the minimum and maximum values of the feature.
  - Example: Scaling all pixel values in an image dataset to the range [0, 1].
- **Z-score Standardization:**
  - Centers the feature values around the mean and scales them based on standard deviation.
  - Mathematical Formulation:
    - $$ z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} $$
    - Where $x$ is the original value, $\mu$ is the mean, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.
  - Example: Standardizing features before applying algorithms like PCA, which assume normally distributed data.

## 5. Scaling

### Definition:
Scaling involves adjusting the range of features to bring them to a similar scale. It is a critical step when the features have different units or magnitudes, which can affect the performance of machine learning algorithms.

### Techniques:
- **MaxAbs Scaling:**
  - Scales the data by the maximum absolute value of each feature, preserving the sign of the data.
  - Mathematical Formulation:
    - $$ x' = \frac{x}{|x_{\text{max}}|} $$
    - Where $|x_{\text{max}}|$ is the maximum absolute value of the feature.
  - Example: Useful for sparse data like text, where preserving the sparsity pattern is important.
- **Robust Scaling:**
  - Scales features using statistics that are robust to outliers, such as the median and interquartile range (IQR).
  - Mathematical Formulation:
    - $$ x' = \frac{x - \text{median}(x)}{\text{IQR}(x)} $$
    - Where IQR is the interquartile range, calculated as $Q3 - Q1$.
  - Example: Scaling features in datasets with outliers that might otherwise dominate the feature scaling.
