## 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### Definition:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The goal is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

### Key Concepts:
- **Tokenization:** The process of splitting text into individual words or phrases (tokens).
- **Stemming/Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their base or root form.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging:** Assigning grammatical categories (noun, verb, etc.) to each token.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying and classifying named entities (e.g., people, organizations, dates) in text.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).

### Common Algorithms:

#### 1.1 Bag of Words (BoW)
- **Description:** Represents text as a vector of word frequencies. Each word in the vocabulary corresponds to a feature.
- **Mathematical Representation:**
  - If $V$ is the vocabulary of all unique words in the corpus and $n$ is the number of words in a document, then the document is represented as a vector of word counts: $[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_V]$ where $x_i$ is the count of word $i$ in the document.
- **Use Case:** Document classification tasks, such as spam detection or topic categorization.

#### 1.2 Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
- **Description:** Weighs the importance of a word in a document relative to its frequency across all documents. It reduces the weight of common words that appear in many documents.
- **Mathematical Formulation:**
  - $$ \text{TF-IDF}(t, d) = \text{TF}(t, d) \times \log \left( \frac{N}{\text{DF}(t)} \right) $$
  - Where $\text{TF}(t, d)$ is the term frequency of term $t$ in document $d$, $N$ is the total number of documents, and $\text{DF}(t)$ is the document frequency of term $t$.
- **Use Case:** Feature extraction for text classification, such as identifying key terms in legal documents.

#### 1.3 Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- **Description:** Represents words in a continuous vector space where semantically similar words are close to each other. This approach captures the contextual meaning of words.
- **Mathematical Representation:**
  - Word embeddings are represented as vectors of real numbers in a high-dimensional space. For example, $word_i$ is represented as a vector $\mathbf{v}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is the embedding dimension.
- **Use Case:** Semantic analysis, machine translation, and text generation tasks.

#### 1.4 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- **Description:** RNNs are a type of neural network designed for sequential data. LSTMs are a variant of RNNs that can learn long-term dependencies in sequences.
- **Mathematical Formulation:**
  - For RNN: $h_t = g(W_x \cdot x_t + W_h \cdot h_{t-1} + b)$
  - Where $h_t$ is the hidden state at time step $t$, $x_t$ is the input at time $t$, $W_x$ and $W_h$ are weight matrices, and $b$ is the bias vector.
  - LSTMs add mechanisms for controlling the flow of information (forget gate, input gate, output gate).
- **Use Case:** Language modeling, speech recognition, and text summarization.

### Applications:
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzing customer reviews to determine overall sentiment.
- **Machine Translation:** Translating text from one language to another using models like RNNs or Transformer architectures.
- **Chatbots:** Building conversational agents that can understand and respond to user queries.

## 2. Predictive Analytics

### Definition:
Predictive Analytics involves using statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze historical data and make predictions about future outcomes. It is widely used in various domains to forecast trends, behavior, and events.

### Key Concepts:
- **Regression Analysis:** Predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables.
- **Classification Analysis:** Predicting a categorical outcome based on predictor variables.
- **Time Series Forecasting:** Analyzing time-ordered data points to predict future values.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying rare or unusual patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior.

### Common Algorithms:

#### 2.1 Linear Regression
- **Description:** A regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
- **Mathematical Formulation:**
  - $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \dots + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon $$
  - Where $y$ is the dependent variable, $x_1, \dots, x_n$ are the independent variables, $\beta_0, \dots, \beta_n$ are the coefficients, and $\epsilon$ is the error term.
- **Use Case:** Predicting sales revenue based on advertising spend, pricing, and other factors.

#### 2.2 Decision Trees and Random Forest
- **Description:** Decision Trees split the data into subsets based on the value of input features. Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs.
- **Mathematical Formulation:**
  - Decision Trees use criteria like Gini impurity or entropy to decide splits:
  - $$ \text{Gini}(D) = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{C} p_i^2 $$
  - Random Forest aggregates the predictions from multiple trees:
  - $$ \hat{f}(x) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} T_m(x) $$
- **Use Case:** Predicting customer churn in telecom or subscription services.

#### 2.3 Time Series Models (ARIMA)
- **Description:** ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models are used for analyzing and forecasting time series data by capturing the temporal dependencies.
- **Mathematical Formulation:**
  - $$ y_t = c + \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \phi_2 y_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_p y_{t-p} + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + \dots + \theta_q \epsilon_{t-q} + \epsilon_t $$
  - Where $y_t$ is the value at time $t$, $\phi$ represents the autoregressive terms, $\theta$ represents the moving average terms, and $\epsilon_t$ is the error term.
- **Use Case:** Forecasting stock prices, sales, and other financial metrics.

#### 2.4 Logistic Regression
- **Description:** A classification algorithm used for binary outcomes. It predicts the probability of a binary event occurring.
- **Mathematical Formulation:**
  - $$ P(y=1|x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \dots + \beta_nx_n)}} $$
- **Use Case:** Predicting whether a customer will buy a product based on demographic and behavioral data.

### Applications:
- **Fraud Detection:** Identifying fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns in historical data.
- **Customer Retention:** Predicting which customers are likely to churn and identifying factors that contribute to churn.
- **Demand Forecasting:** Predicting future product demand to optimize inventory management.
