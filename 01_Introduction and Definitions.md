## 1. What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think and act like humans. These systems can perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

### Key Definitions:
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** A branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI that involves training machines to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
- **Deep Learning:** A specialized area of machine learning involving neural networks with many layers, enabling machines to recognize patterns and perform complex tasks like image and speech recognition.

## 2. Introduction to Algorithms

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. In AI, algorithms are used to process data, make decisions, and learn from patterns.

### Types of AI Algorithms:
- **Search Algorithms:** Used to explore possible solutions in a problem space (e.g., A* algorithm).
- **Classification Algorithms:** Used to categorize data into predefined classes (e.g., Decision Trees).
- **Regression Algorithms:** Used to predict continuous values based on input data (e.g., Linear Regression).
- **Clustering Algorithms:** Used to group data points based on similarities (e.g., K-Means).

## 3. Practical Examples of AI

### Example 1: Spam Email Detection
AI is used in email services to detect and filter out spam messages. Machine learning algorithms analyze the content of emails and classify them as spam or not spam based on learned patterns.

### Example 2: Recommendation Systems
Platforms like Netflix and Amazon use AI to recommend movies, shows, or products to users. These systems use algorithms that analyze user behavior and preferences to suggest items that the user might be interested in.

### Example 3: Virtual Assistants
AI powers virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, enabling them to understand natural language, recognize voice commands, and perform tasks such as setting reminders, sending messages, or playing music.
