## 1. Types of Machine Learning Models

### 1.1 Linear Models

#### Linear Regression
- **Purpose:** Predicts a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.
- **Characteristics:** Assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.

- **Mathematical Formula:**
  \[
  y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \dots + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon
  \]
  - Where \( y \) is the predicted value, \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept, \( \beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_n \) are the coefficients for each feature \( x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \), and \( \epsilon \) is the error term.

- **Use Case:** Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of rooms.

#### Logistic Regression
- **Purpose:** Used for binary classification tasks (e.g., yes/no, spam/not spam).
- **Characteristics:** Outputs probabilities and uses a sigmoid function to map predicted values to a range between 0 and 1.

- **Mathematical Formula:**
  \[
  P(y=1|x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \dots + \beta_nx_n)}}
  \]
  - Where \( P(y=1|x) \) is the probability that the target variable \( y \) equals 1 given the input \( x \), and \( \beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_n \) are the model coefficients.

- **Use Case:** Classifying emails as spam or not spam.

### 1.2 Tree-Based Models

#### Decision Trees
- **Purpose:** Models decisions and their possible consequences using a tree-like structure.
- **Characteristics:** Simple to understand and interpret, can handle both classification and regression tasks.

- **Decision Rule:**
  At each node, the data is split based on a feature \( x_j \) and a threshold \( t \). The rule is:
  \[
  \text{if } x_j \leq t \text{, go to left node; otherwise, go to right node.}
  \]

- **Use Case:** Customer segmentation based on demographic data.

#### Random Forest
- **Purpose:** An ensemble method that creates multiple decision trees and combines their outputs for more accurate predictions.
- **Characteristics:** Reduces overfitting and improves accuracy by averaging the predictions of individual trees.

- **Mathematical Formula (for Regression):**
  \[
  \hat{f}(x) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} T_m(x)
  \]
  - Where \( \hat{f}(x) \) is the final prediction, \( M \) is the number of trees, and \( T_m(x) \) is the prediction from the \( m \)-th tree.

- **Use Case:** Predicting creditworthiness based on financial history.

### 1.3 Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Purpose:** A powerful classifier that works well with both linear and non-linear data.
- **Characteristics:** Finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.

- **Mathematical Formula:**
  \[
  f(x) = \text{sign}(w \cdot x + b)
  \]
  - Where \( w \) is the weight vector, \( x \) is the input vector, and \( b \) is the bias term. The goal is to maximize the margin \( \frac{1}{\|w\|} \) between the two classes.

- **Use Case:** Image recognition, where the goal is to classify images into categories.

### 1.4 Neural Networks
- **Purpose:** Models complex patterns in data, particularly in tasks involving images, text, and speech.
- **Characteristics:** Composed of layers of interconnected neurons; capable of learning hierarchical representations.

- **Mathematical Notation:**
  - **Neuron (in a layer):**
    \[
    a^{[l]} = g(W^{[l]}a^{[l-1]} + b^{[l]})
    \]
    - Where \( a^{[l]} \) is the activation at layer \( l \), \( W^{[l]} \) and \( b^{[l]} \) are the weights and biases, and \( g \) is the activation function (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid).

  - **Loss Function (for binary classification):**
    \[
    J(W, b) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left[ y^{(i)} \log(\hat{y}^{(i)}) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log(1 - \hat{y}^{(i)}) \right]
    \]
    - Where \( m \) is the number of training examples, \( y^{(i)} \) is the true label, and \( \hat{y}^{(i)} \) is the predicted probability.

- **Use Case:** Deep learning applications like facial recognition and natural language processing.

### 1.5 Clustering Models

#### K-Means Clustering
- **Purpose:** Groups data points into a specified number of clusters based on their features.
- **Characteristics:** Iteratively assigns data points to clusters, minimizing the variance within each cluster.

- **Mathematical Notation:**
  \[
  \text{minimize } \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x \in C_i} \| x - \mu_i \|^2
  \]
  - Where \( k \) is the number of clusters, \( C_i \) is the \( i \)-th cluster, \( x \) is a data point, and \( \mu_i \) is the centroid of the \( i \)-th cluster.

- **Use Case:** Market segmentation, where customers are grouped based on purchasing behavior.

#### Hierarchical Clustering
- **Purpose:** Builds a tree of clusters, where each node is a cluster that contains its child clusters.
- **Characteristics:** Does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance; can be visualized as a dendrogram.

- **Mathematical Concept:**
  - **Linkage Methods:** 
    - **Single Linkage:** \( \text{min} \{ d(x, y) : x \in A, y \in B \} \)
    - **Complete Linkage:** \( \text{max} \{ d(x, y) : x \in A, y \in B \} \)
    - **Average Linkage:** \( \frac{1}{|A||B|} \sum_{x \in A} \sum_{y \in B} d(x, y) \)
  - Where \( A \) and \( B \) are clusters, and \( d(x, y) \) is the distance between points \( x \) and \( y \).

- **Use Case:** Organizing documents into categories based on content similarity.

### 1.6 Dimensionality Reduction Models

#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Purpose:** Reduces the number of features in a dataset while preserving as much information as possible.
- **Characteristics:** Transforms the original features into a new set of uncorrelated features called principal components.

- **Mathematical Notation:**
  \[
  Z = XW
  \]
  - Where \( Z \) is the matrix of principal components, \( X \) is the original data matrix, and \( W \) is the matrix of eigenvectors (principal directions).

- **Use Case:** Simplifying datasets for visualization or to improve model performance.

## 2. Characteristics of ML Models

### 2.1 Interpretability
- **Definition:** The ease with which a human can understand the predictions made by a model.

- **Examples:**
  - **High Interpretability:** Linear regression and decision trees.
  - **Low Interpretability:** Neural networks and ensemble methods.

### 2.2 Complexity
- **Definition:** The computational resources required to train and use the model, and the model's ability to capture complex patterns.

- **Examples:**
  - **Low Complexity:** Linear models.
  - **High Complexity:** Neural networks and deep learning models.

### 2.3 Flexibility
- **Definition:** The modelâ€™s ability to fit a wide range of functions and adapt to different types of data.

- **Examples:**
  - **Less Flexible:** Linear models, which assume a specific relationship between inputs and outputs.
  - **More Flexible:** Neural networks, which can approximate almost any function.

### 2.4 Overfitting vs. Underfitting

### 2.4 Overfitting vs. Underfitting

- **Overfitting:** When a model learns not only the underlying patterns but also the noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization to new data.
  
- **Underfitting:** When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on both training and new data.

- **Mathematical Representation:**
  - **Bias-Variance Tradeoff:**
    \[
    \text{Total Error} = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance} + \text{Irreducible Error}
    \]
    - **Bias:** Error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm.
    - **Variance:** Error due to the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set.

- **Examples:**
  - **Overfitting:** Complex models like deep neural networks trained on small datasets.
  - **Underfitting:** Simple models like linear regression applied to non-linear data.

## 3. Model Evaluation Methods

### 3.1 Cross-Validation
- **Purpose:** To assess how a model generalizes to an independent dataset.

- **Method:** The dataset is divided into \( k \) subsets, and the model is trained on \( k-1 \) subsets while being tested on the remaining subset. This process is repeated \( k \) times, with each subset used as the test set once.

- **Mathematical Notation:**
  \[
  \text{CV Error} = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} \text{Error}_i
  \]
  - Where \( \text{Error}_i \) is the error on the \( i \)-th fold.

- **Use Case:** Ensures that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of data.

### 3.2 Confusion Matrix
- **Purpose:** A performance measurement for classification models, showing the actual vs. predicted classifications.

- **Components:**
  - **True Positives (TP):** Correctly predicted positive cases.
  - **True Negatives (TN):** Correctly predicted negative cases.
  - **False Positives (FP):** Incorrectly predicted positive cases.
  - **False Negatives (FN):** Incorrectly predicted negative cases.

- **Mathematical Representation:**
  \[
  \text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
  \]
  \[
  \text{F1 Score} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
  \]

- **Use Case:** Evaluating classification models, particularly in imbalanced datasets.

### 3.3 Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
- **Precision:** The proportion of true positives among all predicted positives.

- **Recall (Sensitivity):** The proportion of true positives among all actual positives.

- **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two metrics.
