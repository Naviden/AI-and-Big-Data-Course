## 1. Tree-based Methods

### Definition:
Tree-based methods involve algorithms that use a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. These models split data into branches to make predictions.

### Key Concepts:
- **Root Node:** The top node in a tree representing the entire dataset.
- **Leaf Nodes:** The terminal nodes that represent the output prediction.
- **Splitting:** The process of dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes based on certain conditions.

### Common Algorithms:

#### 1.1 Decision Trees
- **Description:** A decision tree is a simple, interpretable model that splits data into subsets based on the value of input features. The splits are chosen to maximize information gain or minimize impurity.
- **Mathematical Formulation:**
  - **Gini Impurity:** $Gini(D) = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{C} p_i^2$
  - **Entropy:** $Entropy(D) = - \sum_{i=1}^{C} p_i \log_2(p_i)$
  - Where $p_i$ is the proportion of class $i$ in the dataset $D$.
- **Use Case:** Customer segmentation, where the goal is to classify customers based on their behaviors.

#### 1.2 Random Forest
- **Description:** An ensemble method that creates multiple decision trees and combines their outputs. Each tree is built on a random subset of the data and features.
- **Mathematical Formulation:**
  - **Prediction:** $\hat{f}(x) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} T_m(x)$
  - Where $M$ is the number of trees, and $T_m(x)$ is the prediction from the $m$-th tree.
- **Use Case:** Predicting credit risk by aggregating predictions from multiple trees.

#### 1.3 Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
- **Description:** A sequential ensemble method where each tree corrects the errors of the previous ones. It optimizes a loss function by adding weak learners (small trees).
- **Mathematical Formulation:**
  - **Model:** $f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x) + \alpha \cdot h_m(x)$
  - Where $f_m(x)$ is the model after $m$ trees, $h_m(x)$ is the new tree added at step $m$, and $\alpha$ is the learning rate.
- **Use Case:** Improving model accuracy for tasks like sales forecasting by iteratively correcting mistakes.

## 2. Ensemble Methods

### Definition:
Ensemble methods combine multiple machine learning models to produce a better predictive performance than any single model could achieve.

### Key Concepts:
- **Bagging:** Reduces variance by averaging predictions from multiple models trained on different subsets of the data.
- **Boosting:** Reduces bias by sequentially building models that correct the errors of the previous ones.
- **Stacking:** Combines different types of models by using their outputs as inputs to a final meta-model.

### Common Algorithms:

#### 2.1 Bagging
- **Description:** An ensemble technique where multiple instances of the same model (e.g., decision trees) are trained on different subsets of the data, and their predictions are averaged.
- **Mathematical Formulation:**
  - **Prediction:** $\hat{f}(x) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} f_m(x)$
  - Where $f_m(x)$ is the prediction from the $m$-th model.
- **Use Case:** Random Forest is a popular bagging technique used for classification and regression tasks.

#### 2.2 AdaBoost
- **Description:** A boosting technique where each subsequent model focuses more on the instances that were misclassified by previous models.
- **Mathematical Formulation:**
  - **Weight Update:** $w_{i}^{(m+1)} = w_i^{(m)} \cdot \exp(\alpha_m \cdot I(y_i \neq \hat{y}_i))$
  - Where $w_i$ is the weight of the $i$-th instance, $\alpha_m$ is the model's weight, and $I(y_i \neq \hat{y}_i)$ is an indicator function that is 1 if the prediction is incorrect.
- **Use Case:** Improving model performance in scenarios like face detection in images.

## 3. Neural Networks

### Definition:
Neural networks are a family of models inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of neurons that transform the input data through non-linear operations to produce an output.

### Key Concepts:
- **Neuron:** The basic unit of a neural network, which computes a weighted sum of inputs and passes it through an activation function.
- **Activation Function:** Introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns. Common activation functions include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh.
- **Layers:** Networks typically consist of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.

### Mathematical Formulation:
For a neuron in layer $l$, the output is given by:

$$ a^{[l]} = g(W^{[l]}a^{[l-1]} + b^{[l]}) $$

Where:
- $a^{[l-1]}$ is the input from the previous layer,
- $W^{[l]}$ are the weights,
- $b^{[l]}$ is the bias, and
- $g$ is the activation function.

### Common Types of Neural Networks:
- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN):** The simplest type of neural network where information moves in only one direction—from input to output.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** Specialized for processing grid-like data such as images.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):** Suitable for sequence data as they maintain a memory of previous inputs.

### Use Case:
- **Image Recognition:** CNNs are widely used for tasks such as identifying objects in images.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** RNNs are commonly used for tasks like language translation and sentiment analysis.

## 4. Deep Neural Networks

### Definition:
Deep neural networks are neural networks with multiple hidden layers, allowing them to model complex patterns in data. The depth of the network enables the model to learn hierarchical representations.

### Key Concepts:
- **Depth:** The number of layers in the network. Deep networks typically have more than three layers.
- **Backpropagation:** The algorithm used to train deep networks by computing gradients and updating the weights.
- **Vanishing/Exploding Gradients:** Challenges in training deep networks where gradients can become very small or very large, hindering the learning process.

### Mathematical Formulation:
The output of a deep neural network is given by:

$$ a^{[L]} = g(W^{[L]}a^{[L-1]} + b^{[L]}) $$

Where $L$ is the total number of layers.

### Applications:
- **Deep Learning in Autonomous Vehicles:** Deep networks are used for tasks like object detection, lane detection, and decision-making in autonomous driving.
- **Generative Models:** Deep neural networks, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), are used to generate new data samples that resemble a given dataset.
