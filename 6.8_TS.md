## 1. Time Series Forecasting

### Definition:
Time series forecasting is the process of using historical data to predict future values. In a time series, data points are indexed in time order, and the goal is to model the underlying patterns to make accurate predictions.

### Key Concepts:
- **Trend:** A long-term increase or decrease in the data.
- **Seasonality:** Repeating patterns or cycles of behavior over a specific period.
- **Cyclical Patterns:** Fluctuations in the data that occur at irregular intervals.
- **Stationarity:** A property of a time series where the statistical properties, such as mean and variance, do not change over time.

### Techniques:
- **Moving Averages:** Smoothing the time series by averaging data points within a sliding window.
- **Exponential Smoothing:** Giving more weight to recent observations while smoothing the data.

### Use Case:
- **Stock Price Prediction:** Predicting the future prices of stocks based on historical price data, identifying trends, and seasonal effects.

## 2. ARIMA Models

### Definition:
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a class of models used for forecasting time series data by capturing the underlying temporal dependencies. ARIMA models are particularly effective for data that is stationary or can be made stationary through differencing.

### Key Components:
- **AR (AutoRegressive):** The model uses the dependency between an observation and a number of lagged observations (previous time steps).
- **I (Integrated):** Involves differencing the raw observations to make the time series stationary.
- **MA (Moving Average):** The model uses the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.

### Mathematical Formulation:
An ARIMA model is specified by three parameters: $(p, d, q)$, where:
- $p$ is the number of lag observations (AR term).
- $d$ is the degree of differencing (I term).
- $q$ is the size of the moving average window (MA term).

The ARIMA model is expressed as:

$$ Y_t = c + \phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \phi_2 Y_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_p Y_{t-p} + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + \dots + \theta_q \epsilon_{t-q} + \epsilon_t $$

Where:
- $Y_t$ is the differenced time series,
- $c$ is a constant,
- $\phi$ represents the coefficients for the autoregressive terms,
- $\theta$ represents the coefficients for the moving average terms,
- $\epsilon_t$ is the error term.

### Use Case:
- **Sales Forecasting:** ARIMA models are used to forecast sales based on historical data, accounting for trends and seasonality in sales patterns.

## 3. LSTM for Time Series

### Definition:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequence data. LSTMs are particularly effective in handling time series data because they can learn to remember information over long periods, making them suitable for time series forecasting.

### Key Concepts:
- **Memory Cell:** The core unit of an LSTM network, which maintains the cell state and controls information flow using gates.
- **Forget Gate:** Decides what information from the previous cell state to discard.
- **Input Gate:** Determines what new information to add to the cell state.
- **Output Gate:** Controls the output based on the cell state.

### Mathematical Formulation:
The LSTM cell is governed by the following equations:

$$ f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) $$

$$ i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) $$

$$ \tilde{C}_t = \tanh(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C) $$

$$ C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * \tilde{C}_t $$

$$ o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) $$

$$ h_t = o_t * \tanh(C_t) $$

Where:
- $x_t$ is the input at time $t$,
- $h_{t-1}$ is the previous hidden state,
- $f_t$, $i_t$, $o_t$ are the forget, input, and output gates, respectively,
- $C_t$ is the cell state,
- $W_f$, $W_i$, $W_C$, $W_o$ are the weight matrices,
- $b_f$, $b_i$, $b_C$, $b_o$ are the bias terms,
- $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function,
- $\tanh$ is the hyperbolic tangent function.

### Use Case:
- **Energy Consumption Forecasting:** LSTMs can be used to predict future energy consumption based on past usage data, capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.
